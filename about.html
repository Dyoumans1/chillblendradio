          <div class="about-intro">
            <p class="highlight-text">
              I'm Mskithedjâ€”a world-class athlete turned world-building DJ, and
              this journey is more than a career move. It's a story of
              transformation, healing, and rediscovery.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-paragraphs">
            <p>
              For years, I lived and breathed competition as a nationally
              recognized athlete. When injury brought my track career to a
              sudden stop, I was forced to face a life without the sport that
              had always defined me.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then, I turned to music. DJing gave me the same adrenaline
              rush, the same sense of rhythm and timing, but with a freedom and
              emotional depth I had never felt before. Music became my therapy,
              and the decks became my new arena.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, every time I step behind the decks, I bring that same
              discipline, focus, and heart that once made me a champion. Whether
              I'm spinning live on TikTok, rocking a pop-up, or throwing a party
              that feels like a movement, I'm doing it with full intention and
              unmatched energy.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight-text">
              This is just the beginning. The vision is bigger, the purpose is
              deeper, and the vibes are unstoppable. Come be part of this
              journey with me.

                It was so great to have Ms. Ki DJ my global 60th virtual
                birthday celebration. With a global theme, we had attendees from
                all over the world. She worked with us on music selection and
                hosted the party for us. She was professional and highly
                responsive. Definitely hiring her again.

                It was very organized, and she was very intune with the crowd.

                Ki the DJ WAS AMAZING !! SO! I had a near catastrophic incident
                with the original DJ we had ordered. And three days before I was
                forced to find a DJ. Ki was the first to respond back, listened
                to the problem I was experiencing and volunteered to DJ our
                reception ... Even while waiting for someone who had contacted
                her before me. She showed up at the agreed time and totally
                TURNED our reception upside down! The music, the flow, the vibe
                ALL AMAZING! And I know two people at our reception who plan to
                hire her for their upcoming events! Ki truly was amazing. And an
                AMAZING PERSON as well !! Even participated in our Photo Booth.
                My wife with Ki the DJ !! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND !! THANK YOU
                AGAIN KI !!
